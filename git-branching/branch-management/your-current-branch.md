**What's your branch's 'currency'...?**

Git allows you to seamlessly create multiple branches and it is therefore important to know your current working branch; you cannot be everywhere every time, or are you omnipresent!!

Git knows the local branch you're currently on by keeping a special pointer called \_'HEAD'. \_In this case, you're still on master; the `git branch` command only created a new branch \(\_testing \_in this case\) - it never switched to that branch.

The next page explains how to switch to an existing branch.
