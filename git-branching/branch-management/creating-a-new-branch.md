**It's this simple...**

`git branch branch_name`

where 'branch\_name' is your preferred name for the branch. However, it makes sense to give a branch a descriptive name that more or less matches its purpose. For instance, if you're fixing a critical issue during development, it may suffice to name your branch '_hotfix_' or if your working on some tests, you could call it...you guessed right, '_testing_'.



**When you create a new branch...**

a new pointer is created for you to move around as it's flexible \(from our definition of a branch\).



Therefore, creating a new branch called _testing _creates a new pointer at the same commit you're currently on.

`git branch testing`
