**It's this simple...**

`git branch branch_name`

where 'branch\_name' is your preferred name for the branch. However, it makes sense to give a branch a descriptive name that more or less matches its purpose. For instance, if you're fixing a critical issue during development, it may suffice to name your branch '_hotfix_' or if your working on some tests, you could call it...you guessed right, '_testing_'.
