# Contributing to the Git Push Freshman project

Many thanks for your interest in contributing to the Git Push Freshman project!

We'll spent most of our time developing an evolving open curriculum for this project. This is an e-book edited and published using <a href="https://www.gitbook.com">GitBook</a>. 

As such, efforts of technical reviewers including but not limited to project contributors and maintainers using GitHub, tech bloggers, Open Educational Resources (OER) contributors,  educators, are highly welcome in co-authoring the curriculum.

Presented in this document is a set of guidelines to help you out in your contribution to this project, making it easy for you to get involved.

## Participation guidelines

This project adheres to a <a href="https://github.com/ottagit/git_push_freshman/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">code of conduct</a> to be upheld for a perpetual positive environment.

## GitHub Flavored Markdown
In the course of your contribution to this project, you are likely to encounter Markdown files with the *.md * extension. The Markdown standard will be used to style text on the web. If you need help with getting started with *.md* files, here's a <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ ">guide to mastering markdown</a>

## Open Curriculum

The <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/ottagit/git-push-freshman-open-curriculum/details">open curriculum</a> is the core of this project and has been made open for editing. Feel free to remix it.

## How to submit changes 

<b>N.B.</b> The open curriculum has been synchronized with <a href="https://github.com/ottagit/git_push_freshman">this repository</a>. Any changes made to the repository are automatically updated in the destination file in the git book; the converse is true, that is, changes made to the Git book reflect in the synced repository.

To import and sync this repository:

<ol>
  <li>Visit the <b>Installed integrations</b> section of your GitHub account <b>Settings</b> page</li>
  <li>Click on <b>Browse Directory</b> the select <b>GitBook</b> from the list of available options</li>
  <li>Add the integration to GitHub</li>
  <li>Grant read/write permission (should be the default)</li>
  <li>Configure repository access to <b>Only select repositories</b> then choose this repository</li>
  <li>Save the configuration settings and you're good to go </li> 
</ol>

Identify your area of interest in which you are willing to contribute to the project, then follow the following steps
in making your changes to the project repository.

### 1. This repository

As outlined above, to apply the skills gained from using the open curriculum, a sample informational website for the project will be designed in the course of the project. This section is particularly relevant for the beneficiaries of the training program, that is, the freshmen with whom I closely work. However, anyone is free to follow the steps below in contributing towards the design process.

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> <b>this repository</b> to make your own copy of
  this project wich you can use and edit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes">Make your changes</a> either on the 
  GitHub interface, or your local machine by cloning the repository; this gives you a local copy of the repository.</li>
  <li>Submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull request</a> around your project
  notifying your project lead on your proposed changes.</li>
</ol>

### 2. The Open Curriculum

<ol>
  <li>Open your <a href="http://gitbook.com">GitBook</a> account </li>
  <li>Create a new book by importing and syncing an existing repository,  (in this case the forked repository above)</li> 
  <li>Click on the <b>Edit</b> button and make changes to your preferred articles on the <b>TOC</b> in the sidepane</li>
  <ul><li><i>Use <b>change requests</b> when experimenting with ideas</i></li></ul>
  <li>Once the change request is ready, you can accept and <b>merge</b> it from the online view. Once merged, the changes will make it to the <b>primary version</b> and will be published. Good job!</li>
  <ul><li>If you are not happy with the changes, you can also close the change request without merging it. The change request can be reopened anytime without any loss.</li></ul>
  <li>With changes reflected on the forked repository, remember to create a pull request (same as <b>step 3 above</b>)</li>
</ol>
